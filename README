SWE 437 Homework 7 
Spring 2012
Faults, Errors, and Failures

Exercise Section 1.2, Number 3. Instead of using one of the four given programs, use the program given below:

class Vehicle implements Cloneable {

   private int x;

   public Vehicle(int y) { x = y;}

   public Object clone() { 
      Object result = new Vehicle(this.x);
      // Location "A"
      return result;
   }
   // other methods omitted
}
class Truck extends Vehicle {

   private int y;

   public Truck(int z) { super(z); y = z;}

   public Object clone() {
      Object result = super.clone();
      // Location "B"
      ((Truck) result).y = this.y;  // throws ClassCastException
      return result;             
   }
   // other methods omitted
}
Those of you who studied Bloch in CS/SWE 332 should find this code familiar. As a hint, the fault is in the code just prior to Location A.

Note that a test in this context simply involves instantiating some object of a suitable class and calling the clone() method.

Note: Students unfamiliar with Bloch can access Item 11, the relevant item, in Bloch on page 54:
