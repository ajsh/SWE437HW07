	 * The fault is that Vehicle's clone returns new Vehicle(this.x) instead of 
	 * using super.clone. The result is that Object's clone is never called, so
	 * the result is not of the correct class, and thus, cannot be cast into a 
	 * Truck.

	//Part D if possible identify a test case that results in an error, but not a failure. Hint: Don't forget about the program counter
	//Part E For the given test case, identify the first error state. Be sure to describe the complete state. 
	//Part F Fix the fault and verify that the given test now produces the expected output.
